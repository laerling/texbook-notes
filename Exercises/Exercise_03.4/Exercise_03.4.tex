Number of possible characters except the escape character:

A-Z = 26
a-z = 26
========
      62

Length 2: After an escape character there can be 256 8-bit
characters. That is 256 possible control sequences of length 2.

Length 3: Both characters after the escape character have to be
[A-Za-z], so we have 52*52 = 2704 possible control sequences of
length 3.
