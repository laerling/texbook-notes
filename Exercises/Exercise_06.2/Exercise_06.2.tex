I am not sure if line 2 in the output is a typographical error since it is longer than line 1 or line 3 because it is not indented, but I think the typographical error meant here is the missing space after the second em-dash (there is a space right after the first one).

This happens because there is a linebreak after the three hyphens in the tex file.
