Unfortunately not. Though I've been wondering that for a long time, too!

I expected a technical answer but the actual answer is far from it:

Reverse slashes (backslashes) are fairly uncommon in formulas or text, and two backslashes in a row are very easy to type; it was therefore felt best not to reserve the token consisting of two backslashes in a row for such limited use. Typists can define this token to be whatever they want (including the backslash).
