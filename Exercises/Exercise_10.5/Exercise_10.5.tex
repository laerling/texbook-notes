For example, to get magnification 1200 say:
`{\tt $\backslash$magnification=$\backslash$magstep1 $\backslash$input story $\backslash$end}'

{\tt $\backslash$magstep2} and {\tt $\backslash$magstep3} are 1440 and
1728.  Three separate runs are needed, since there can be at most one
magnification per job. The output may look funny if the fonts don't
exist at the stated magnifications.
