#### These are solutions to the exercises from the TeXbook by Donald E. Knuth.

I only solve the unmarked exercises as of now. Marked exercises are meant for advanced TeX users.

I don't end the files with `\end`, because oftentimes I want to experiment a bit, which is best done in an interactive TeX session that hasn't `\end`ed yet.
